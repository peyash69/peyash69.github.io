     		<h2>Personal Info</h2>
     			<p>One of the Commissioner’s <font color="red">primary</font> roles is to investigate and try to resolve privacy complaints against organizations. While findings on a given issue may differ depending on the facts of each case and the position of the parties. Over time, findings on certain key issues have begun to crystallize into general principles that can serve as helpful guidance for <big>organizations</big>.</p>
     			<p>In an effort to summarize the general principles that have emerged from court decisions and the Commissioner’s findings to date, the OPC issues Interpretations of certain key concepts in <strong>PIPEDA</strong>. These Interpretations are not binding legal interpretations, but rather, are intended as a guide for compliance with <i>PIPEDA</i>. As the Commissioner issues more findings, and the courts render more decisions, these Interpretations may evolve and be further refined over time.</p>
